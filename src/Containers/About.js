const Poem = `After every war \n someone has to clean up. \n Things won’t \n straighten
themselves up, after all. \n Someone has to push the rubble \n to the side
of the road, \n so the corpse-filled wagons \n can pass. \n Someone has to get
mired \n in scum and ashes, \n sofa springs, \n splintered glass, \n and bloody
rags. \n Someone has to drag in a girder \n to prop up a wall. \n Someone has
to glaze a window, \n rehang a door. \n Photogenic it’s not, \n and takes
years. \n All the cameras have left \n for another war. \n We’ll need the
bridges back, \n and new railway stations. \n Sleeves will go ragged \n from
rolling them up. \n Someone, broom in hand, \n still recalls the way it was. \n
Someone else listens \n and nods with unsevered head. \n But already there
are those nearby \n starting to mill about who will find it dull. \n From
out of the bushes \n sometimes someone still unearths \n rusted-out
arguments \n and carries them to the garbage pile. \n Those who knew \n hat
was going on here \n must make way for \n those who know little. \n And less
than little. \n And finally as little as nothing. \n In the grass that has
overgrown \n causes and effects, \n someone must be stretched out \n blade of
grass in his mouth \n gazing at the clouds. \n `;
